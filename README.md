## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Alzheimer’s Disease using structural MRI brain scans and machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can automatically distinguish between cognitively normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s Disease based on neuroimaging data.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is critical for timely intervention, improved patient care, and better clinical decision-making. However, manual interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming and subject to variability. This project explores how data-driven models can support clinicians by providing objective and scalable predictions.

The project includes data preprocessing of MRI scans, feature extraction, model training and evaluation, and visualization of results. Different modeling approaches are explored, and performance is assessed using standard evaluation metrics.
