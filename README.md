## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Alzheimer’s Disease using structural MRI brain scans and machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can automatically distinguish between cognitively normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s Disease based on neuroimaging data.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is critical for timely intervention, improved patient care, and better clinical decision-making. However, manual interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming and subject to variability. This project explores how data-driven models can support clinicians by providing objective and scalable predictions.

The project includes data preprocessing of MRI scans,exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, model training and evaluation, and visualization of results. Different modeling approaches are explored, and performance is assessed using standard evaluation metrics.

## Problem Statement
Alzheimer disease is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory , thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out simple tak. This makes it one of the common causes of dementia. World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 ranked Alzheimer disease as the 7th leading cause of death globally although it varies by region and reporting methodology.
Statistics reveals that 50 million people worldwide are living with dementia as at 2020 (WHO, 2020). Making it more indigestible, WHO estimates an increase in Alzheimer cases from 50 million (record as at 2019) to 139 million by 2050 which sosunds really alarming. 
Currently there is no cure for the disease thus the need for early intervention or better still prevention. One way to curtail this is to reverse trends by moving field from a reactive care approach to a more proactive data driven solution.
